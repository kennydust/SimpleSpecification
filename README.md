# SimpleSpecification
Simple Specification is a library that uses the Specification Pattern. This library aims to be actively updated as it intends to be used in real world use-cases and projects.

In computer programming, the specification pattern is a particular software design pattern, whereby business rules can be recombined by chaining the business rules together using boolean logic. The pattern is frequently used in the context of DDD (domain-driven design).

Introduced by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler circa 2004 via Domain Driven Design.

Pattern refined from examples from https://github.com/vkhorikov/
